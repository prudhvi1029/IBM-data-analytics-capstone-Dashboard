# Module 5: Dashboard Creation

### Overview

In this module, we created an interactive and insightful dashboard using IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio. The dashboard visualizes the results of the Kaggle 2023 survey data, providing a user-friendly, drillable view into current technology usage, future trends, and demographics. This dashboard helps effectively communicate key insights through charts and tables.

### Learning Objectives

### In this module, we aimed to:

* Utilize IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio to enhance and organize data visualizations.
* Demonstrate proper chart type selection to represent different data insights.
* Build a dashboard that clearly presents the survey’s key findings and is easy to navigate and interpret.

### Key Tasks

#### Current Technology Usage Tab:
* Top 10 Languages: Created a bar chart to show the top 10 programming languages respondents have worked with (LanguageHaveWorkedWith).
* Top 10 Databases: Visualized the top 10 databases respondents have worked with (DatabaseHaveWorkedWith) using a bar chart.
* Platforms: Showcased the various platforms respondents have worked with (PlatformHaveWorkedWith) in a bar chart.
* Top 10 Web Frameworks: Displayed the top 10 web frameworks used by respondents (WebframeHaveWorkedWith) using a bar chart.
#### Future Technology Trends Tab:
* Top 10 Languages Desired for the Next Year: Created a bar chart to display the top 10 programming languages respondents wish to learn (LanguageWantToWorkWith).
* Top 10 Databases Desired for the Next Year: Visualized the top 10 databases respondents want to learn (DatabaseWantToWorkWith).
* Desired Platforms for the Next Year: Presented platforms respondents desire to work with (PlatformWantToWorkWith).
* Top 10 Web Frameworks Desired for the Next Year: Showed the top 10 web frameworks respondents aim to learn (WebframeWantToWorkWith).
#### Demographics Tab:
* Respondent Count by Work Experience: Created a chart to show respondents categorized by years of work experience (WorkExp).
* Respondent Count for Countries: Used a map chart to display the number of respondents from various countries (Country).
* Respondent Count by Age: Visualized the distribution of respondents across different age groups (Age).
* Respondent Count by Gender and Education Level: Created a stacked bar chart to show respondents by gender (Gender), further categorized by education level (EdLevel).

### Results and Insights

* The Current Technology Usage Tab revealed the most widely used technologies, highlighting languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks respondents are currently familiar with.
* The Future Technology Trends Tab provided insight into respondents’ desired technologies, indicating upcoming trends in language, database, and platform preferences for the next year.
* The Demographics Tab gave an overview of the respondents’ backgrounds, including work experience, geographic distribution, age demographics, and education levels.

### Conclusion

This module helped create a comprehensive and interactive dashboard to showcase the Kaggle 2023 survey insights. By visualizing current trends, future preferences, and demographics, this dashboard provides a clear overview of the survey findings. This tool can be further enhanced and used to analyze other datasets for effective presentation of key data insights.
