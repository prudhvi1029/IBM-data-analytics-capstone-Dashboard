# Module 4: Data Visualization and Analysis

### Overview

In this module, we focused on visualizing the cleaned dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships among variables. Using various types of plots and charts, we aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data, making it easier to communicate insights and guide further analysis. This step provides valuable context for the modeling stage in future modules.

### Learning Objectives

In this module, we aimed to:

* Explore and understand the distribution of various features in the dataset.
* Visualize relationships between key variables.
* Identify patterns and trends that could inform further analysis.
* Build visualizations that effectively communicate the findings.

### Key Tasks

##### Feature Distribution Visualization:
* Created histograms for numeric columns to analyze their distribution.
* Plotted a bar chart for categorical features to understand their frequency distribution.
##### Scatter Plot Analysis:
* Generated scatter plots to examine relationships between ConvertedComp and Age.
* Identified and interpreted any visible trends or patterns.
##### Box Plot Analysis:
* Created box plots to visualize the distribution and detect any remaining outliers in key columns, including ConvertedComp and Age.
* Compared distributions before and after outlier removal to verify data refinement.
##### Correlation Heatmap:
* Generated a heatmap to display correlations between numerical features.
* Highlighted the strongest correlations for further analysis in subsequent modules.
##### Advanced Visualizations:
* Created additional plots, such as violin plots, to illustrate the data distribution and variability in ConvertedComp and other key columns.

 ### Results and Insights

* Observed the distribution and variability of key demographic and financial features.
* Confirmed a weak positive correlation between Age and ConvertedComp.
* Identified patterns that suggest potential influences of certain variables on compensation.
* Developed an understanding of how visualizations can highlight key trends and anomalies.

### Conclusion

This module emphasized the power of data visualization in revealing hidden patterns and relationships in the dataset. These insights will guide feature selection and preparation in subsequent analysis and modeling stages, enhancing the interpretability of findings.
