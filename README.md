# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

### Overview

This repository contains the full set of tasks and assignments completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project, which showcases a comprehensive skill set in data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and dashboard creation. This project serves as an end-to-end data analysis workflow, covering the core skills of a professional Data Analyst.

### Project Objective

The primary objective of this project was to analyze real-world survey data collected from software professionals worldwide to identify emerging skills and technology trends. The project assumes the role of an Associate Data Analyst tasked with collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to support strategic planning and talent development for a global IT and business consulting firm.

### Key Skills Demonstrated

#### * Data Collection: Collecting data from APIs and web scraping techniques
#### * Data Wrangling: Cleaning and preparing data by handling missing values, duplicates, and normalizing data
#### * Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing data distribution, detecting outliers, and identifying correlations
#### * Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations for data composition, relationships, and trends
#### * Dashboard Creation: Developing interactive dashboards to present findings and key insights

### Project Modules

The project is structured into six modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of data analytics. The breakdown is as follows:

#### Module 1: Data Collection
Techniques for collecting data via APIs and web scraping.
#### Module 2: Data Wrangling
Cleaning and transforming data for analysis.
#### Module 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Performing statistical and correlation analysis on cleaned data.
#### Module 4: Data Visualization
Visualizing key data insights and trends using Python libraries.
#### Module 5: Dashboard Creation
Creating an interactive dashboard with IBM Cognos Analytics.
#### Module 6: Presentation of Findings
Summarizing analysis in a final report and presentation for stakeholders.

### Technologies Used

#### * Languages: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
#### * Database: SQL
#### * Business Intelligence Tool: IBM Cognos Analytics
#### * Other Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Excel, Requests Library for Web Scraping

### Dataset

The project uses a subset of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset, which includes responses from approximately 90,000 developers globally. This dataset offers insights into developer tools, programming languages, technologies, and demographics.

### Repository Structure

Each moduleâ€™s assignment is available as a standalone Jupyter notebook with the completed analysis and code. A README file accompanies each module, detailing the tasks, objectives, and learnings specific to that module.

This project exemplifies my expertise in the complete data analysis workflow, from data collection and preparation to analysis and insightful visualization. This capstone project is a valuable addition to my portfolio, highlighting both technical and analytical skills essential for data-driven decision-making.
